This project involves the development of two chatbots integrated into WordPress websites for the Canadian Institute of Technology. Each chatbot serves a specific purpose:

General Information Assistant: Available to everyone on the university's public website, this chatbot answers general inquiries about the university. Prospective students and parents can leave their contact information for follow-up by the university's secretary.

Student Information Portal: Accessible via a secure login, this chatbot provides current students with personalized access to their subject results and academic information.

These chatbots aim to enhance user interaction and improve access to information at the university.
